Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This time series is an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions     2017-06-19   2017-06-19 
and Contractions data provided by The National Bureau of Economic     
Research (NBER) at http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html. Our    
time series is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of  
expansion and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters of   
turning points without designating a date within the period that      
turning points occurred. The dummy variable adopts an arbitrary       
convention that the turning point occurred at a specific date within  
the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment on 
this issue by the NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee. A value of 1
is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary       
period. For this time series, the recession begins the first day of   
the period following a peak and ends on the last day of the period of 
the trough. For more options on recession shading, see the notes and  
links below.                                                          
                                                                      
The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the   
source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. 
We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three     
arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available     
using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough 
is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively 
extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually 
and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or 
in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the 
recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession 
period.                                                               
                                                                      
The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a  
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the   
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession  
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of   
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly    
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough      
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the  
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly    
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its   
own publications. A version of this time series represented using the 
midpoint method can be found at:

The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a   
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. 
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first    
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the 
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough    
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. The trough method 
is used for this series.                                              
                                                                      
The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a      
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is 
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily  
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak  
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series    
represented using the peak method can be found at:
